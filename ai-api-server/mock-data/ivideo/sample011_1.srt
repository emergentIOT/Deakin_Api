00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,150
On Monday, about 270 pilot whales

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,380
got into difficulty

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,060
on a sand bank at MacQuarie

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,740
heads near Strahn on

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,330
Tasmania's West coast.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,810
About 190 kilometers
from Hobart.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,330
The Department of
primary industry,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,414
parks, Water and
Environment,

9
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:23,010
DPIPWE said

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,150
the whales were stranded at

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,515
three different sites.

12
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,680
Adding, this morning that
about a third had died.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,034
Why do whales
strand themselves?

14
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,640
Dr. Vanessa Pirotta from

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,395
Macquarie University said,

16
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,225
it remains a mystery.

17
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,745
Whales use echolocation
to navigate.

18
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:39,570
They're seeing the world

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,740
through clicks and sounds.

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,010
She said, Dr Pirotta

21
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,600
said the current event
could be a case

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,060
of an individual
or couple leading

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,140
the pod and they've

24
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,464
misnavigated
the waterway.

25
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,220
She said the
animals leading

26
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,645
the pod may have
been frightened,

27
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,160
and taken evasive action,

28
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,290
which had led the
group into trouble,

29
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,150
or perhaps a sense of
adventure had led them

30
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,120
astray. maybe
something startled

31
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,964
them or maybe they're
just curious.

32
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:08,165
Dr. Pirotta said, Nick
Deka from DPIPWE,

33
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,670
said Australia's
southern-most state

34
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,865
was known for mass
whale standings.

35
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,070
Whale strandings
are not uncommon in

36
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,960
Tasmania and
whale strandings,

37
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,165
of this scale are
not uncommon either.

38
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,710
But certainly we haven't

39
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,120
had one for at
least ten years.

40
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,800
He said.
